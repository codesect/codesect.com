        <p>
          We believe that part of what makes learning on CodeSect special is the
          chance to talk to other learners from all over the world and learn
          from each other. Being a part of this community means behaving with
          honesty, respect, and kindness to fellow learners and educators.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming
          environment for all, regardless of age, body size, disability,
          ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
          nationality, neurotype, race, religion (or lack thereof), sexual
          orientation, and socioeconomic status. CodeSect is dedicated to
          providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not
          tolerate harassment of participants in any form.
        </p>
        <p>
          This code of conduct applies to all CodeSect spaces, including our
          Site, Discord chats, GitHub page, YouTube comments, both online and
          during in-person events. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may
          be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the
          CodeSect Team.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some CodeSect spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be
          made clearly available to participants. Participants are responsible
          for knowing and abiding by these rules.
        </p>
        <h2>Our Standards</h2>
        <p>
          Examples of behaviour that contributes to creating a positive
          environment include:
        </p>
        <ul>

            gender-neutral pronouns when uncertain
          </li>
          <li>Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback</li>
          <li>
            Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our
            mistakes, and learning from the experience
          </li>
          <li>
            Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
            overall community
          </li>
          <li>Showing empathy towards other community members</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Examples of unacceptable behaviour include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political
            attacks
          </li>
          <li>Public or private harassment</li>
          <li>
            Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
            address, without their explicit permission
          </li>
          <li>
            Physical contact and simulated physical contact (e.g. textual
            descriptions like "hug" or "backrub") without consent or after a
            request to stop
          </li>
          <li>
            The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
            advances of any kind
          </li>
          <li>
            Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging
            a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm
          </li>
          <li>Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease</li>
          <li>
            Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in
            a professional setting
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Reporting</h2>
        <p>
          If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that
          you report it by emailing info@codesect.com. Please include your name
          and a description of the incident. All complaints will be reviewed and
          investigated promptly and fairly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes, participants violating the code of conduct are unaware that
          their behaviour is harmful, and an open conversation clears things up
          to move forward. However, if a participant continues with the
          behaviour, the CodeSect team may take any action they deem
          appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all CodeSect spaces
          and identification of the participant as a harasser to other CodeSect
          members or the general public.
        </p>
        <h2>Diversity Statement</h2>
        <p>
          CodeSect welcomes and encourages participation by everyone. No matter
          how you identify yourself or how others perceive you: we welcome you.
          We welcome contributions from everyone as long as they interact
          constructively with our communities.
        </p>
