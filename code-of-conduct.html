          CodeSect is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for
          everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.
        </p>
        <p>
          This code of conduct applies to all CodeSect spaces, including our
          GitHub page and our Discord chat, both online and during in-person
          events. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or
          expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the CodeSect Team.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some CodeSect spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be
          made clearly available to participants. Participants are responsible
          for knowing and abiding by these rules.
        </p>
        <h2>Harassment includes:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and
            expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness,
            neurotype, physical appearance, body, age, race, ethnicity,
            nationality, language, or religion
          </li>
          <li>
            Unwelcome comments regarding a person's lifestyle choices and
            practices, including those related to food, health, parenting,
            drugs, and employment
          </li>
          <li>Deliberate misgendering or use of 'dead' or rejected names</li>
          <li>
            Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces where
            they're not appropriate
          </li>
          <li>
            Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual
            descriptions like "hug" or "backrub") without consent or after a
            request to stop
          </li>
          <li>Threats of violence</li>
          <li>
            Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging
            a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm
          </li>
          <li>Deliberate intimidation</li>
          <li>Stalking or following</li>
          <li>

          </li>
          <li>Sustained disruption of discussion</li>
          <li>Unwelcome sexual attention</li>
          <li>
            Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming
            inappropriate levels of intimacy with others
          </li>
          <li>Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease</li>
          <li>
            Deliberate "outing" of any aspect of a person's identity without
            their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from
            intentional abuse
          </li>
          <li>Publication of non-harassing private communication</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Reporting</h2>
        <p>
          If you are being harassed by a member of CodeSect, notice that someone
          else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the
          CodeSect Team at [support@codesect.com]. If the person who is
          harassing you is on the team, they will recuse themselves from
          handling your incident. We will respond as promptly as we can.
        </p>
        <p>
          This code of conduct applies to CodeSect spaces, but if you are being
          harassed by a member of CodeSect outside our spaces, we still want to
          know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by
          CodeSect members seriously. This includes harassment outside our
          spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The abuse
          team reserves the right to exclude people from CodeSect based on their
          past behavior, including behavior outside CodeSect spaces and behavior
          towards people who are not in the CodeSect community.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the
          right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith.
          Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted
          without response.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting
          victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person
          about whom we've received harassment complaints, or privately warn
          third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase
          the safety of CodeSect members or the general public. We will not name
          harassment victims without their affirmative consent.
        </p>
        <h2>Consequences</h2>
        <p>
          Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to
          comply immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a participant engages in harassing behavior, CodeSect Team may take
          any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from
          all CodeSect spaces and identification of the participant as a
          harasser to other CodeSect members or the general public.
        </p>
        <h2>Diversity Statement</h2>
        <p>
          CodeSect welcomes and encourages participation by everyone. No matter
          how you identify yourself or how others perceive you: we welcome you.
          We welcome contributions from everyone as long as they interact
          constructively with our communities.
